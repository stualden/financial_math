    \textbf{Amortization} in its simplest form is the repayment of a debt with level payments ("installments"),
    where each installment covers the full amount of interest that has accrued, plus a portion of the outstanding
    principal.  An \textbf{amortization schedule} is a table with a line for each payment (showing the
    total payment, the interest portion, and the principal portion), and the outstanding principal immediately after
    that payment has been made.  At the beginning, principal is just $ A $ (present value of the annuity), and at
    the end, principal goes to 0.  To illustrate, using \$100 over 4 periods at 10\% per period:

    If the outstanding principal $ P $ is needed at any point $ k $ during the term of
    the loan, it can be calculated using the standard annuity formulas, either \textit{prospectively} or
    \textit{retrospectively}.  Here, if

    \item\textbf{k    } - Number of periods from beginning, at which to measure outstanding principal (so $ k $ is between 0 and n)
    \item\textbf{P    } - Outstanding principal immediately after the $ k $th payment
    \item\textbf{{$ \ax{ \angl{n-k} i} $}} - Present value of the $ n-k $ remaining payments
    \item\textbf{{$ \sx{ \angl{k} i} $}} - Accumulated Value of $ k $ payments thus far

    \textbf{Notes:} \\
\end{flushleft}

\begin{itemize}
    \item One reason for distinguishing between principal and interest in loan repayments is that for U.S.
          federal tax purposes, interest is (potentially) tax deductible, whereas principal is not.
    \item Knowing outstanding principal is also useful--for example, the market value of a home minus the
          outstanding principal on a mortgage represents the homeowner's \textbf{equity} in the home.
